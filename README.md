**The desktop layer for personal AI agents.** Windie gives agents a visible,
always-present surface on your computer: a chat pill that follows you across the
operating system, watches the current screen when you ask for help, and shows
what the agent is doing in real time.

No setup flow, no extension pinned to one tab, and no model lock-in. Download
Windie, talk to the pill, and let the agent use computer-use, browser-use,
terminal, files, and memory from the desktop you already work in.

## Why Windie

<table>
<tr><td><b>No setup desktop agent</b></td><td>Windie is built for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Download the app, open it, and start talking to your agent from the desktop.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>An operating-system layer</b></td><td>The floating chat pill stays with you while the agent works, so you can see its reactions, tool calls, and progress instead of guessing what the model is doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Computer-use for any model provider</b></td><td>Windie's computer-use tools run through its own local tool contract, so they are not limited to one vendor's native computer-use model.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Hands-free voice</b></td><td>Say "Hey Jarvis", talk into the mic, and Windie transcribes your speech into the query that starts the agent loop.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Dedicated browser-use profile</b></td><td>Windie uses its own persistent Chrome profile instead of attaching an extension to one of your normal browser tabs.</td></tr>

## Desktop Experience

**The first state is the minimal chat pill.** It floats on your screen, stays
out of the way, and can automatically attach the current screen when you send a
message. This is the state you should live in most of the time.

**The second state is the fullscreen dashboard.** It shows the longer
conversation, live tool logs, memory surfaces, settings, and everything else
you need when you want to inspect the agent loop closely.

Windie is designed to feel present without taking over the computer. It gives
the agent a place to react while it clicks, types, browses, runs commands, or
waits for you to redirect it.

## Quick Start

### Download

[**Download here**](https://windieos.com)

Windie is designed for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Run From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buiilding/Windie-agent.git
cd Windie-agent
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Install sidecar dependencies:

```bash
cd ..
./scripts/python-in-env sidecar python -m pip install -r frontend/src/main/python/requirements.txt
```

Start the renderer:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

In another terminal, start Electron:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run electron:dev
```

By default, the client is designed to talk to the configured hosted WindieOS
backend. Use `BACKEND_*` or `WINDIE_BACKEND_*` overrides only when pointing the
client at another compatible backend.

The public client docs intentionally describe the Electron frontend, Python
sidecar, browser-use runtime, local memory, packaging, and hosted transport
contracts. Private hosted backend implementation docs are not part of this
repository.
