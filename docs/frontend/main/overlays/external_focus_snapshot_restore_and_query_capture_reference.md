# Overlay Query-Capture Blur and Settle Reference

## Canonical Modules

- `frontend/src/main/index.cjs`
- `frontend/src/main/ipc.cjs`
- `frontend/src/main/query_payload_builder.cjs`
- `frontend/src/main/main_window_runtime.cjs`

## Platform Scope

Overlay query-capture prep is now platform-consistent:

- no native external-window snapshot/restore path
- no `node-window-manager` dependency
- send/capture prep is blur-only plus a short settle delay before capture continues

## Query-Capture Pre-Focus Hook

`prepareOverlayQueryCaptureFocus()` sequence:

1. blur `chatWindow` when available
2. blur `mainWindow` when available
3. blur `responseWindow` when available
4. wait settle duration (`120ms` default)

This hook is registered into IPC init as `onBeforeOverlayQueryCapture`.

Intent:

- reduce chance of capturing WindieOS overlay/main windows in screenshot query path
- give compositor/focus stack time to settle before system-state capture runs without trying to foreground another app

## Integration with Query Send Pipeline

Main process query relay flow calls the hook before capture-enriched query send path.

Coupled behavior:

- overlay chat UI can remain visible without any cross-app focus handoff
- query-time system state and screenshot capture are less likely to sample WindieOS windows as active

## Drift Hotspots

1. removing settle delay and causing intermittent self-capture
2. reintroducing platform-specific focus-restore behavior into the shared send path
3. changing the blur target list without updating tests/docs for the capture hook

## Debug Checklist

If overlay captures itself in screenshot path:

1. verify `onBeforeOverlayQueryCapture` callback is wired in IPC init
2. verify the visible WindieOS windows expose `blur()` and the hook is calling them
3. verify the settle delay is still present in the hook path before capture continues

If chatbox focus behavior regresses after toggle:

1. inspect `showChatWindow({focus:true})` ordering
2. verify `showChatWindow({focus:false})` still uses non-activating show when available
3. verify no new external-app focus restore path was introduced into normal show/send flow
