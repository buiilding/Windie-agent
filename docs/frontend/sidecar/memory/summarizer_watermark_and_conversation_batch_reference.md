# Summarizer Watermark and Conversation Batch Reference

## Canonical Modules

- `frontend/src/main/python/memory/summarizer.py`
- `frontend/src/main/python/memory/local_store.py`
- `frontend/src/main/python/memory/watermark_state.py`
- `frontend/src/main/python/core/remote_semantic_client.py`
- `tests/sidecar/test_memory_summarizer.py`

## Runtime Purpose

The sidecar summarizer periodically converts episodic interaction rows into semantic memories while preventing duplicate summaries and uncontrolled background churn.

Dev toggle:

- `WINDIE_ENABLE_SEMANTIC_SUMMARIZER=0` disables summarizer startup in `local_backend.py`.
- When disabled, episodic writes still persist to local memory; periodic semanticization loop does not run.

## Settings and Scheduling Model

`SummarizerSettings` defaults:

- `interval_seconds=60`
- `idle_seconds=120`
- `min_batch_size=6`
- `min_batch_size_idle=1`
- `max_batch_size=30`
- `min_memory_age_seconds=45`
- `max_summaries_per_cycle=3`
- `max_conversations_per_cycle=5`
- `max_chunk_chars=24000`
- `max_chunks_per_request=20`
- backoff window: `30..600` seconds

Loop behavior:

- `_run_loop()` performs an immediate wake on startup/new memory, then waits `interval_seconds` (or active backoff) between attempts
- `_maybe_summarize()` is lock-guarded to avoid concurrent cycles
- backoff doubles on cycle-level failure until max, resets after successful cycle

## Run Gate and Watermark State

Cycle entry checks DB state and requires either:

- `count_unsemanticized_interaction_memories() >= min_batch_size`, or
- `count_unsemanticized_interaction_memories() >= min_batch_size_idle` while summarizer activity is idle

Watermark lifecycle:

- watermark pending fields are no longer the run gate
- pending counter is reset to zero when at least one summary is produced in cycle (`update_watermark(..., pending_message_count=0)`)

Watermark storage:

- JSON file via `WatermarkStateStore`
- fields: `last_semanticized_id`, `pending_message_count`, `last_updated`
- read/write performed in shared thread pool to avoid loop blocking

## User and Conversation Selection

User selection in `_get_user_ids_with_work()`:

- preferred source: `_known_user_ids` (populated by `notify_new_memory(user_id)`)
- DB discovery augments known IDs up to `max_conversations_per_cycle`

Conversation selection:

- `get_unsemanticized_conversation_windows(user_id)` ordered by earliest unsummarized timestamp
- cycle enforces `max_conversations_per_cycle`

## Per-Conversation Summarization Flow

`_summarize_conversation_batch(user_id, conversation_id)`:

1. load unsummarized interaction memories for conversation (`max_batch_size` cap)
2. apply batch readiness rules (`_should_summarize_batch`)
3. compute deterministic summary hash from user/conversation/memory IDs
4. if semantic summary already exists, mark source memories semanticized and skip API call
5. build chunked conversation payload
6. call remote semantic summarizer
7. format semantic content (`Summary:` + `Facts:` blocks)
8. persist semantic memory with provenance metadata
9. mark source episodic memories semanticized

## Batch Readiness Rules

`_should_summarize_batch(memories)` returns true when:

- memory count reaches `min_batch_size`, or
- memory count reaches `min_batch_size_idle` and idle/age thresholds pass

Timestamp handling:

- parses ISO timestamps, normalizes `Z` suffix to UTC offset
- naive timestamps get local tz then normalized to UTC
- failures fall back to idle heuristic

## Interaction Chunking

Before summarization, each memory row is normalized by `_format_memory_line`.

Normalization:

- line prefix includes role/message_type/tool_name when available
- content clipped to `1600` chars per memory line

Chunking:

- per-line clipping against `max_chunk_chars`
- chunk accumulation split by `max_chunk_chars`
- total chunks capped by `max_chunks_per_request`

## Store Queries Used by Summarizer

`LocalMemoryStore` queries enforce interaction-only summarization surface:

- unsemanticized user discovery: `record_kind='interaction' AND is_semanticized=0`
- conversation windows: grouped by `conversation_id`
- memory batch load: interaction rows ordered chronologically
- semantic dedupe check: `semantic_summary_exists(summary_hash)` via metadata lookup

## Test-Backed Behavior

`tests/sidecar/test_memory_summarizer.py` validates:

- interaction rows are used to build semantic request chunks
- one user batch failure does not prevent processing remaining users
- known-user activity is merged with discovered backlog users
- cold-start discovery returns the current backlog window of users
- mixed timezone timestamp parsing remains stable
- idle low-volume run gating for `_should_run()`
- summarizer performs an immediate startup cycle

## Drift Hotspots

1. Breaking interaction-row count queries can leave summarizer permanently gated or always active.
2. Loosening transcript tool-entry filtering can pollute semantic memory with low-signal execution chatter.
3. Altering summary-hash inputs can reintroduce duplicate semantic writes for same memory window.
4. Raising chunk size/count caps without safeguards can increase semantic request latency and failure blast radius.
